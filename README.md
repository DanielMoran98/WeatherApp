# WeatherApp

## About

A weather application side project I'm currently making using the Openweathermaps API which displays weather in any city around the world, along with upcoming weather in that city.

## Technologies used

HTML/CSS

Javascript

Node.JS

Express

Openweathermaps API

EJS


## Future updates

As I am still working on this project, the trello board I have made which shows what I'll be working on next is available [here](https://trello.com/b/3QlTwaEk/weather-app).


## To run

Add a config.json file in the top level directory containing:
```javascript
{
  "token": "YOUR-OPENWEATHERMAPS-API-KEY-GOES-HERE";
}
```

Then use ```npm install``` to install dependencies.

Finally use ```node server``` to run.
